Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence techniques that enable computers to generate content, such as images, text, or even music, autonomously. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on predefined rules or patterns, generative AI models are trained on large datasets and can produce new, original content that closely mimics human creations.

Generative AI Deployment involves implementing generative AI models into real-world applications. This process typically involves integrating the AI model with existing infrastructure, such as cloud services or APIs, to process user inputs and generate relevant outputs. Deploying generative AI effectively requires considerations such as scalability, efficiency, and ethical use of the generated content.

In this guide, I'll walk you through the steps to deploy a generative AI model using serverless infrastructure. We'll make use of serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to efficiently handle user inputs, process them through the AI model, and deliver dynamic outputs.

## Setting up Infrastructure

First, we'll get access to CohereAI through Amazon Bedrock. Next, we will head over to DynamoDB and create a table, storing everything from user inputs to the generated outputs, We'll then create Lambda function that connects seamlessly with CohereAI via Amazon Bedrock. for API Gateway. We'll use it to create an endpoint that'll expose our Lambda function as a RESTful API and also cloudwatch to store the logs of all the activities going on.

NB: Everything will be deployed in us-west-2 (Oregon), and all resources have to be in the same region for it to work seamlessly

### Setting up access to AWS Bedrock

Head over to the aws Console and search Bedrock, should be a shiny new green icon that looks like this, select it and click "get started"
